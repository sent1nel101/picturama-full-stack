This is the front end for a full stack social media picture and comment sharing application built on Sanity.io, using React JS, some vanilla JS and loads of HTML/CSS.
The app is fully functioning and allows for all the usual CRUD functionality. Creating, rating, updating and deleting posts, as well as adding comments and managing your user account are all built-in features.
